# YOLOv4_UAV_detect
This is the YOLOv4 model designed for detecting mini unmanned aerial vehicles. You can use it by installing the necessary libraries on your device.
Required libraries include OpenCV and Numpy.
The UAV model and configuration file can be found under the Model file directory.
The model file is over 25 MB, so I had to split it into parts.
You can detect the videos or photos you want to analyze by specifying the file path in the Python code.
